# Go Client Example for Facts API

This example demonstrates how to interact with the [Facts API](https://github.com/AsbDaryaee/facts-api) using Go. It includes a simple function `GetARandomFact()` that makes an HTTP GET request to the `/api/facts/random` endpoint, retrieves a random fact in JSON format, and returns it as a Go struct. The example uses Goâ€™s standard `net/http` and `io` packages, emphasizing clear, idiomatic error handling.
